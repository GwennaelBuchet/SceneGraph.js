<p>The cgSceneGraph is a powerful and very easy-to-use Scene Graph framework written in JavaScript for the &lt;canvas&gt; tag in HTML5
It's full oriented object to ease the development of your applications and games.</p>

<p>Since the start of the project, it has been designed to be used on professional application as well as for game development.</p>

<p>Feel free to share your extensions or to publish a link to your projects using the cgSceneGraph :)</p>

</ul><h3>Example of code</h3>

<pre><code>// create a text node at position (20, 10)
var textNode = new CGSGNodeText(20, 10, "my text...");
//add some attributes to the node
textNode.isDraggable = true;
textNode.setSize(18);
//add the node to the scene-graph
this.rootNode.addChild(textNode);
</code></pre>

<p>Just as easy :D</p>

<h3>Why to offer the cgSceneGraph as an open source project ?</h3>
