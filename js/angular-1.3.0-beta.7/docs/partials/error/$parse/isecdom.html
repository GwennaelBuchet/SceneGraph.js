<h1>Error: $parse:isecdom

    <pre class="minerr-errmsg" error-display="Referencing DOM nodes in Angular expressions is disallowed! Expression: {0}">Referencing DOM nodes in Angular expressions is disallowed! Expression: {0}</pre>
</div>

<h2>Description</h2>
<div class="description">
  <p>Occurs when an expression attempts to access a DOM node.</p>
<p>AngularJS restricts access to DOM nodes from within expressions since it&#39;s a known way to
execute arbitrary Javascript code.</p>
<p>This check is only performed on object index and function calls in Angular expressions.  These are
places that are harder for the developer to guard.  Dotted member access (such as a.b.c) does not
perform this check - it&#39;s up to the developer to not expose such sensitive and powerful objects
directly on the scope chain.</p>
<p>To resolve this error, avoid access to DOM nodes.</p>
